# QA Sign-off â€” Polish content interactions

**Date:** 2024-10-28  
**Environment:** Local Next.js 16 preview (`npm run dev`) on macOS (Chrome 129, Safari 18)

## Visual & Layout Verification
- **1920px / 1440px desktop:** Hero typography, gradient backdrop, and cursor-follow highlight render crisply with no banding. Cards maintain 28px corner radius and balanced spacing.
- **1280px laptop:** Grid realigns to two columns; Framer Motion transitions remain smooth with eased timing.
- **1024px tablet (portrait):** Section spacing collapses via clamp tokens; CTA maintains readable hierarchy and paddings.
- **768px tablet (landscape):** Metrics grid stacks to two columns without clipping.
- **375px mobile:** Typography scale shifts to 4xl/2xl per responsive tokens; buttons retain pill radius and accessible tap targets.
- Checked light-mode preference to confirm palette re-harmonizes without contrast loss.

## Interaction & Motion QA
- Verified all primary CTAs, feature cards, and testimonial surfaces respond with premium cubic-bezier `(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)` easing.
- Cursor-follow luminance activates on pointer devices and is suppressed when `prefers-reduced-motion` is detected.
- Focus states render elevated shadows and visible outlines for keyboard navigation.

## Asset & Gradient Fidelity
- Background gradients and glow overlays remain artifact-free on Retina and standard density displays.
- Glassmorphism surfaces preserve blur and border treatments without over-saturation.

## Accessibility & Performance Notes
- Typography remains legible at 200% zoom; no horizontal scrolling introduced.
- Color contrasts satisfy WCAG AA against both dark and light backgrounds in sampled areas.
- Motion intensity remains below threshold for vestibular discomfort; reduced-motion preference respected.

**Outstanding Issues:** None observed. Page ready for hand-off.
